## Case study
**building an income statement with exce**


_You have three sheets represent three years of company data 
 
_First we need to group the relevant data together in one data base

_Will use the code column to join the data of different years together

_Remove all the duplicates from the code column in the new data base 

_Will use index Mach or vlookup but we have to change on the source if we want to use vlookup 

_We can also use mapping to have less categories in the report

The structure will follow:

Revenue 2


  **Total Revenue**

   **Gross margin**
   
Fixed expenses (operating expenses) ثابتة زي الإجار
