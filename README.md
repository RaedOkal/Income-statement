## Case study
building an income statement with exce


You have three sheets represent three years of company data 
 
First we need to group the relevant data together in one data base

Will use the code column to join the data of different years together

Remove all the duplicates from the code column in the new data base 

Will use index Mach or vlookup but we have to change on the source if we want to use vlookup 

We can also use mapping to have less categories in the report

The structure will follow:
 

Revenue 1
Revenue 2
Total Revenue
Direct cost 
Gross margin
Fixed expenses (operating expenses) ثابتة زي الإجار 

EBITDA   (margin - fixed expenses)
"earning before interests taxes, depreciation and amortization"

D&A 
"depreciation & amortization"
 
EBIT  (EBITDA - D&A)
Interests

EBT (EBIT - or + interests)
Taxes

Net income:  (EBT - taxes )
